An Arduino-based platform to track any of your personal belongings.

My BMX bicycle was stolen the same week I moved to San Francisco. I was shocked by the level of desparation required to take a bike that was locked up in a tech sector of such a wonderful city. So, I decided to fight back.

My new ride will have one of these bad boys hidden in one of the hollow compartments. So, if it gets stolen again, it won't be a problem to hunt it down.
